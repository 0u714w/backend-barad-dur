# How Far to Barad Dur?
Determine the shortest distance between two cities.  A recursive routing algorithm project based on a CS210 class at University of Oregon, by [Michal Young.](https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/15W/cis210/assignments/Assnmt5-Routing.php)  This project involves recursion, and you mainly have to carefully design and implement just one recursive function.

You are in the Kingdom of Boringham.  The cities are named a,b,c,d,e,f, and g, with road distances in furlongs as follows:

Your program must determine the shortest possible distance between two cities. For example, if it is asked the difference between a and g on the given map, it should determine that the shortest route is 19 furlongs:
